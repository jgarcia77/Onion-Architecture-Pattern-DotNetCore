# Onion-Architecture-Pattern-DotNetCore
The “Hello World” program is built on the “Onion Architecture Pattern”, which addresses code decoupling and separation of concerns.  Coupling is towards the core therefore, outer layers depend on layers more central and cannot depend on layers further away from the core.  Furthermore, the pattern relies on Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control.  

Below is a general diagram that depicts the “Onion Architecture Pattern”.
